I am developing a react native app to help users learn Kabiy√®.
Technology stack
Expo, Expo router, react-native-ui-lib, phosphor-react-native.
Here is my design system
```
export const brandColors = {
  primary: '#6200EE',
  secondary: '#03DAC6',
  bgGrey: '#F5F5F5',
  textDark: '#212121',
  accent: '#FF5722',
  textLight: '#FFFFFF',
  textGrey: '#757575',
}
```
I am now working on the dictionary functionnality.
I assume content is coming from static files for now, before connecting to a database in the future.
Take inspiration from other popular language learning apps.
My requirement:
Give me all the screens / components / content samples to design the dictionnary functionnality.
Start with the first screen only.
Do not provide too much explanation of the code.
Use as mush styles, components, colors from react-native-ui-lib as you can.
I am using typescript.
